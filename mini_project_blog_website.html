  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hakan Ay<br>
  <strong>Email:</strong> hakanay102688@gmail.com<br>
  <strong>Study Program:</strong> Information Systems<br>
  <strong>City:</strong> Riga<br>
  <strong>Country:</strong> Latvia</p>

  <p>In this mini project, I plan to develop a simple blog website using the <strong>C# programming language</strong>. 
  The main goal of this project is to improve my software development skills and gain hands-on experience with web technologies.</p>

  <p>In this website, users will have the ability to <strong>post comments</strong>. 
  Visitors can share their opinions and interact under my posts. 
  This feature will make the website more dynamic and engaging.</p>

  <p>The main topic of the blog will be about the <strong>countries I have visited</strong>. 
  Each country will have its own post where I describe my experiences, the culture, and the most interesting places to visit.</p>

  <p>Technically, the project will be developed using <strong>ASP.NET Core (C#)</strong>. 
  I plan to use <strong>SQL Server</strong> as the database to store user comments, blog posts, and visitor data.</p>

  <p>My main objective with this project is to strengthen my <strong>web development knowledge</strong> 
  and gain experience in creating a real-world web application. 
  I will also use the <strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</strong> architecture to keep the code structured and organized.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, this mini project will serve as both a <strong>personal blog website</strong> 
  and a <strong>valuable learning experience</strong> in web development.</p>
